<h1>Terms of Use:</h1>

<p>Below are the Terms of Use for the 2014 Anime and Manga Stack Exchange Gift Exchange.</p>

<p>We have kept these short and to the point. Please make sure to read everything. <strong>The instructions to continue
    with your form application are inside.</strong></p>

<h2>Disambiguation:</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Participant</dt>
    <dd>Any of the eligible users of the site that participates in the 2014 Christmas Gift Exchange. Every 
	<em>participant</em> is both a <em>gifter</em> and a <em>giftee</em> (definitions below).
    </dd>
    <dt>Gifter</dt>
    <dd>The person sending the gift.</dd>
    <dt>Giftee</dt>
    <dd>The person receiving the gift.</dd>
    <dt>SE</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange</a></dd>
</dl>
<hr/>
<ol>
    <li>The participants agree to fulfill all of the below requirements. The consequence of not doing so will be the
        exclusion from similar future community events. (alternatively reparations can be made by making a donation on
        behalf of the <em>giftee</em> or <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com">Anime.SE</a> to a
        registered/recognized charity of your choice)
    </li>

    <li>The <em>gifter</em> will not send send/distribute anything harmful, disturbing, or illegal (physically or
        mentally) to the <em>giftee</em> and their respective country, providence, or locale.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>participant</em> acknowledges that this event is formed by the community and not, in any way, endorsed by or
        associated with Stack Exchange or its management and operators.
    </li>

    <li>The participants agree that neither Stack Exchange nor the site is responsible for damage or loss of the parcel
        (including confiscation), any additional taxes or fees levied in the process of delivery.
    </li>

    <li>If the <em>gifter</em> has any circumstances where they feel they cannot participate, due to personal,
        economical, or other reasons (excluding laziness and procrastination), they will message a moderator about
        this and their reasons <strong>before</strong> the <strong>shipping deadline</strong>. (might require a
        charitable donation be made on behalf of your <em>giftee</em> or <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com">Anime.SE</a>)
    </li>

    <li>The deadlines are as follows: Opt-in phase - Up to the end of October; Gift selection phase - Up to mid
        November; Shipping phase - Up to the end of December, preferably arriving before the end of the year.
    </li>

    <li>After the end of the Opt-in phase the participants will be attributed (in the following two days) a <em>giftee</em>, which they (the <em>gifter</em>)
        will contact directly in order to get their (the <em>giftee</em>'s) contact and shipping information. Preferred
        formatting includes your Anime.SE username as c/o (example: Asami Sanada 411 Gamers Rd Apt. 723, c/o Dejiko
        Winter Garden, DG Broccoli
    </li>
    Country).

    <li>By entering the words: "I've read all of these terms" in the opt-in form, the <em>gifter</em> does not have to pick something from a <em>giftee</em>'s wishlist, the only (soft)
        requirement being that the gifts be somewhat anime or manga related. The suggested value for the gifts is $20
        USD or the economic equivalent. Gifts can be digital if the <em>gifter</em> does not have the means of sending a
        physical parcel at a reasonable rate, researching beforehand to ensure that the <em>giftee</em> will not have
        trouble getting access to it in their respective country.
    </li>

    <li>Once the gift is sent, the <em>gifter</em> will inform the <em>giftee</em> by email, along with a tracking
        number (when available). If, for some reason, the <em>gifter</em> feels they will not be able to make the
        deadline for the shipping phase, they will contact the <em>giftee</em> directly informing them of the
        occurrence.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>giftee</em> will inform the <em>gifter</em> once the gift has arrived. Afterwards, all the participants
        will post pictures(s) of their gift on a meta post (which will later be created specifically for this purpose).
        The participants may choose to share an <a href="http://imgur.com">Imgur</a> album if they prefer, along with their reactions to the gifts.
    </li>

    <li>If the <em>giftee</em> has received no gift or been informed that their gift is on the way by the shipping
        deadline, they will contact any of the moderators, so that they can take care of solving their issue as soon as
        possible.
    </li>

    <li>If the participants have any issues during the process, they will contact the moderators.</li>
