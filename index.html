<h2>Disambiguation:</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>Participant</dt>
    <dd>Any of the eligible users of the site that participates in the 2015 Christmas Gift Exchange. Every <em>participant</em>
	is both a <em>gifter</em> and a <em>giftee</em>, and will take part in several <em>committees</em> (definitions below).
    </dd>
    <dt>Committee</dt>
    <dd>A group of <em>participants</em> that will be assigned with the task of choosing a gift for a given <em>giftee</em>
	(definition below). If there are N <em>participants</em> there will be N <em>committees</em>, and each <em>participant</em>
	will take part in N-1 <em>committees</em> — they will be excluded from the <em>committee</em> which is assigned of
	choosing their (that <em>participant</em>'s) gift. For each committee, there is an assigned <em>gifter</em> (definition below).
    </dd>
    <dt>Gifter</dt>
    <dd>The person sending the gift. There is one per <em>committee</em>, and every <em>participant</em> is one.</dd>
    <dt>Giftee</dt>
    <dd>The person receiving the gift. There is one <em>committee</em> per <em>giftee</em>, and every <em>participant</em> is
	a <em>giftee</em>.</dd>
    <dt>SE</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange, Inc.</a></dd>
</dl>

<ol>
    <li>The <em>participants</em> agree to fulfill all of the below requirements. The consequence of not doing so will be the
        exclusion from similar future community events. (alternatively reparations can be made by making a donation on
        behalf of the <em>giftee</em> or <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com">Anime.SE</a> to a
        registered/recognized charity of your choice)
    </li>

    <li>The <em>gifter</em> will not send send/distribute anything harmful, disturbing, or illegal (physically or
        mentally) to the <em>giftee</em> and their respective country, providence, or locale.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>participant</em> acknowledges that this event is formed by the community and not, in any way, endorsed by or
        associated with <em>SE</em> or its management and operators.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>participants</em> agree that neither <em>SE</em> nor the site is responsible for damage or loss of the parcel
        (including confiscation), any additional taxes or fees levied in the process of delivery.
    </li>

    <li>If a <em>participant</em> has any circumstances where they feel they cannot participate, due to personal,
        economical, or other reasons (excluding laziness and procrastination), they will message a moderator about
        this and their reasons <strong>before</strong> the <strong>shipping deadline</strong>. (might require a
        charitable donation be made on behalf of your <em>giftee</em> or <a href="http://anime.stackexchange.com">Anime.SE</a>)
    </li>

    <li>The deadlines are as follows: Opt-in phase - Up to October 10th; Gift selection/conspiracy phase - Up to October 28th;
	Shipping phase - Up to November 4th; preferably arriving before December 20th.
    </li>

    <li>After the end of the Opt-in phase, a mailing list for each <em>committee</em> is set up. Every <em>participant</em> will 
	participate in all <em>committees</em>' mailing lists but a single one — that of the <em>committee</em> which has that <em>participant</em>
	as their <em>giftee</em>.
    </li>

    <li>After the end of the Opt-in phase each <em>participant</em> will be attributed (in the next two days) a <em>giftee</em>, which they 
	(the <em>gifter</em>) will contact directly in order to get their (the <em>giftee</em>'s) contact and shipping information. Preferred
        formatting includes your Anime.SE username as c/o (example: Asami Sanada 411 Gamers Rd Apt. 723, c/o Dejiko
        Winter Garden, DG Broccoli Country). The <em>gifter</em> for each committee will be chosen according to geographical proximity
	with that <em>committee</em>'s <em>giftee</em>, so as to minimize shipping expenses.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>committee</em> does not have to pick something from a <em>giftee</em>'s wishlist, the only (soft) requirement being that the 
	gifts be somewhat anime- or manga-related. The suggested value for the gifts is $20 USD or the economic equivalent. Gifts can be digital 
	if the <em>gifter</em> does not have the means of sending a physical parcel at a reasonable rate, considering the <em>committee</em> 
	agrees to that gift and conducts the proper research beforehand to ensure that the <em>giftee</em> will not have trouble getting access 
	to it in their respective country.
    </li>

    <li>Each <em>gifter</em> will be allowed to veto the <em>committee</em>'s decision with valid reason, such as the gift agreed on being too
	expensive for or inaccessible to the <em>gifter</em>, etc. Furthermore, the words "I approve of tomato" should be entered in the last field of
	the opt-in form!	
    </li>

    <li>Once the gift is sent, the <em>gifter</em> will inform the <em>giftee</em> and the respective <em>committee</em> by email, 
	along with a tracking number (when available, and only relevant to the <em>giftee</em>). If, for some reason, the <em>gifter</em> 
	feels they will not be able to make the deadline for the shipping phase, they will contact the <em>giftee</em> directly informing them of 
	the occurrence, while also keeping the corresponding <em>committee</em> posted.
    </li>

    <li>The <em>giftee</em> will inform the <em>gifter</em> once the gift has arrived, and the latter will subsequently update the corresponding 
	<em>commitee</em>. Afterwards, all the <em>participants</em> will post pictures(s) of their gift on a meta post (which will later be created 
	specifically for this purpose). The <em>participants</em> may choose to share an <a href="http://imgur.com">Imgur</a> album if they prefer, 
	along with their reactions to the gifts.
    </li>

    <li>If the <em>giftee</em> has received no gift or been informed that their gift is on the way by the shipping
        deadline, they will contact any of the moderators, so that they can take care of solving their issue as soon as
        possible.
    </li>

    <li>If the <em>participants</em> have any issues during the process, they will contact the moderators.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case you were hoping to find the instructions to the form here, too bad. Read the whole thing, it's not that long!</p>
